//Debug the program step by step

// 1. adding the break points (the line where you want to stop the execution of the program)
// 2. run the program in debug mode
// 3. wait for the debug options to appear

    //continue => continues the execution of the program until the next break point is hit or the program ends
    //stop => stops the execution of the program
    //restart => restarts the execution of the program from the beginning

    //step over => executes the current line and move to next line
    //step into => go inside the current line and check the background code
    //step out => exits the current function and returns to the main program

//Logic to get the sum of two numbers
